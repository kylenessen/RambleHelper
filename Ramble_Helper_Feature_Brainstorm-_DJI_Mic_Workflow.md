# Ramble Helper Feature Brainstorm

## Context: Improving the DJI Mic Workflow

The DJI Mic is the preferred recording device due to its high quality, wind handling, and convenient ergonomics. However, it has a major flaw that disrupts the processing workflow: it splits recordings longer than 30 minutes into multiple files.

## Proposed Features

### 1. Automatic File Merging on Import

*   **Problem:** Recordings longer than 30 minutes are automatically split into separate files, which complicates the current processing workflow.
*   **Solution:** Ramble Helper should automatically detect these interconnected files upon import and combine them into a single, continuous audio file. In addition, Ramble Helper should convert the WAV files to m4a.
*   **Impact:** Reliably implementing this feature would solve the biggest pain point of using the DJI mics and create a seamless experience from recording to processing.

### 2. Automatic Deletion of Small Files

*   **Problem:** Very short, accidental recordings create clutter and contain little to no useful content.
*   **Solution:** Ramble Helper should automatically delete imported files that are below a set size threshold (e.g., under 5 MB).
*   **Impact:** This simple logic would effectively remove the vast majority of false recordings, cleaning up the project space.

## Conclusion

Implementing these two features would make the DJI Mic an ideal recording device for the Ramble Helper workflow.
